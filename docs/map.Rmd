```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

Create a web page using R Markdown that features a map created with Leaflet.

Host your webpage on either GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

Your webpage must contain the date that you created the document, and it must contain a map created with Leaflet. We would love to see you show off your creativity!

```{r chunk 1}
if(!require(leaflet)){
  install.packages("leaflet")
  library(leaflet)
}
library("leaflet")


my_map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles() 
my_map <- my_map %>% addMarkers(lat=43.6689929, lng= 40.260989162422234, popup="I work here")
my_map
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
